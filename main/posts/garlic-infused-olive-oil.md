Slice your garlic into small flakes , thin enough to give you a good crunch

Put all the flakes into a pan and pour olive oil to a level which would cover all of the garlic flakes

Put the gas on medium heat , and keep it stirring until the flakes turn golden .

Just when they start to turn golden , put out the gas and let the hot olive oil cook the rest of the garlic flakes.  

You're now done , use the garlic infused olive oil and the flakes for garnish , works great with pasta and noodles.
